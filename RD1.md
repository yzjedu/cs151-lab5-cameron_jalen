Objective:

What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?  using while loops and SENTINEL values together.

What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem? we talked, did the algorithm, checked it rewrtoe the algorithm and then programmed after everything else was done


Did your results match what you expected to get? yes they matched wht i got in the test cases execl sheet
Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases? well i used various test cases, but not extreme test cases

What challenges did you encounter? algorithm being correct
How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming? yes
Did you overcome them, and how? yes, we kept rewriting the algorithm
Any key takeaways? SENTINEL values are hard to code at times, and algorithm is hard as well
Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab? using SENTINEL values to exit or end a while loop
What was it like working with your partner? good, fun, i was more of the problem i forgot i had to commit the code
